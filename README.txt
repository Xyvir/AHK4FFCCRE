Currently this is hard-coded to fullscreen 1920 x 1080; I may try to code it for relative resolutions in the future.

You will need:

I. Latest WSABuilds (Run Google Play on Win11 'natively')
   https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds

II. Autohotkey (For KBM)
   https://www.autohotkey.com/download/

III. Anti MicoX (to map Joypad to KBM)
   https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox

How to setup.

1. Install FFCCRE from PlayStore in WSA, then Launch

2. Launch the AutoHotKey script.

3. If you are only using KMB, you are done, if you want Joypad continue on.

6. Connect your Joypad

7. Launch AntiMicroX

8. Load 'FFCCRE.gamecontroller.amgp' in AntiMicroX

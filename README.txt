AutoHotKey for Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicals Remaster (Android)

This Auto-hotkey script aims to make FFCC Android version 100% playable with KBM or a Joypad on a PC.

I ended up using AntiMicroX in addition to AutoHotKey as I didn't like the limitations with AutoHotkey mapping an analog stick to WADS.

Currently this is hard-coded to fullscreen 1920 x 1080; I may try to code it for relative resolutions in the future.

You will need:
===================================================================

I. Latest WSABuilds (Run Google Play on Win11 'natively')
   https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds

II. Autohotkey (For KBM)
   https://www.autohotkey.com/download/

III. Anti MicoX (to map Joypad to KBM)
   https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox

How to setup.
===================================================================

1. Install FFCCRE from PlayStore in WSA

2. Launch the AutoHotKey script.

3. If you are only using KMB, skip to 7, if you want Joypad continue on.

4. Connect your Joypad

5. Launch AntiMicroX

6. Load 'FFCCRE.gamecontroller.amgp' in AntiMicroX

7. Launch FFCC in WSA and make it fullscreen with F11.
